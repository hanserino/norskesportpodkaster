description: >-
  ntroducing a running podcast for people who think running podcasts are stupid.
  This is an ultrarunning comedy podcast instead. So if you are looking for
  inspirational or deep, thought-provoking content, you will probably DNF your
  next race just from listening to this.  Dom Grossman and Andy Pearson host
  this monthly variety show with guests who are probably too famous to be on it,
  totally worthless advice call-in segments, and other dumb jokes designed to
  make you shoot gel through your nose.
